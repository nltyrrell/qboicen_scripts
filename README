OLD ROUTINE
To generate output from the QBOi models for use in a jupyter-notebook 
running tigramite:
1) Run each cdo_[model].sh script.
This will generate csv files for each actor timeseries.
2) Run the script run_combine_actors.sh
This will combine the actor timeseries into one csv file,
which can be stored in a dropbox folder and read by a notebook
running on co-lab
